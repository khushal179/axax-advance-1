**DeFi Kingdoms Clone README**

Welcome to the DeFi Kingdoms Clone repository! This repository contains the foundational smart contracts and setup instructions for creating a decentralized finance (DeFi) game similar to DeFi Kingdoms. In this README, you'll find information on setting up an EVM subnet on Avalanche, defining your native currency, connecting to MetaMask, and deploying basic building blocks for your game.

### Setting Up Your EVM Subnet on Avalanche

To set up your EVM subnet on Avalanche, please refer to the provided guide and the Avalanche documentation. This subnet will serve as the underlying infrastructure for your DeFi game, allowing you to deploy and interact with smart contracts on the Avalanche network.

### Defining Your Native Currency

Within your DeFi game, you'll want to establish a native currency that serves as the in-game currency for players. This currency will be used for various interactions within the game, such as trading, battling, and exploring. You can define your native currency using the smart contract templates provided in this repository.

### Connecting to MetaMask

To connect your EVM subnet to MetaMask, follow the steps outlined in our guide. This process involves configuring MetaMask to connect to your custom EVM subnet on Avalanche, allowing users to interact with your game through their MetaMask wallets.

### Deploying Basic Building Blocks

Utilizing Solidity and Remix, you can deploy the basic building blocks of your game. These smart contracts will define the game rules and mechanics, including liquidity pools, tokens, battling mechanisms, exploring features, and trading functionalities. The provided smart contract templates serve as a starting point for implementing these game mechanics.
